What is Window Functions:

Windows functions (also known as windowed or analytic functions) in T-SQL allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row within a result set. These functions are especially useful when you want to compare or aggregate data within a specific "window" or range of rows.

Types of Window Functions in T-SQL

Aggregate Functions: Used to perform calculations over a range of values. Examples include SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN().
Ranking Functions: Used to assign a ranking or a row number to each row in a partition. Examples include ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE().
Analytic Functions: Used for advanced analytical operations like moving averages or cumulative totals. Examples include LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE().
